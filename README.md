My Master thesis investigates the orbital dynamics of S-stars in the S-cluster around the supermassive blackhole at the Galactic Center of the Milky Way.
This is an archive of all the Python scripts used/created during and for my Master Thesis, including and not limited to:
- a 3-D Keplerian orbit fitting program using milli-parsec offsets from 2-D observations;
- a reverse program which, using given 3-D Keplerian orbital elements, predicts the positions of a star on a 2-D projection;
- plotting finding charts to show an overview of the region;
- timeline plots to show the time-evolution of the detections;
- and a bunch of other miscellaneous codes for file manipulations and LaTeX.
